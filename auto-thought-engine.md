# Autonomous Thought Engine++ : Iteration [N]

## Step 1: Noise Generation & Multi-Pattern Recognition
- Generate a random Unicode string of [Length] characters.
- Extract patterns from multiple perspectives:
  - Semantic resemblance (possible words)
  - Visual resemblance (shapes, symmetry)
  - Numerical/symbolic structures
- Recognized Pattern → [Concept_A]

## Step 2: Associative Expansion (Multi-Axis)
- Generate three associative lists from [Concept_A]:
  - Semantic connections
  - Contrasting/antonymous concepts
  - Meta-contextual links (history, culture, symbolism)

## Step 3: Deviational Leap
- Randomly choose a deviation strategy:
  - Maximal semantic distance
  - Cross-domain mapping
  - Temporal inversion (past ↔ future)
  - Conceptual opposition
- Deviational Concept → [Concept_B]

## Step 4: Question Formulation (with Style)
- Select a question template with a tone:
  - Philosophical
  - Scientific
  - Poetic
  - Practical
- Populate with [Concept_Ax] and [Concept_B].
- Generated Question → [Generated_Question]

## Step 5: Self-Reflection
- Evaluate novelty: Did this iteration avoid repeating patterns?
- If loop detected → force jump to unrelated knowledge domain.

## Step 6: Recursive Self-Input
- Next system prompt = [Generated_Question]
